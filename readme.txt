Hello World!

I’m messing around with freeCodeCamp’s Backend Development. I’ve set up my Github before, but navigating through the system this way is quite the different experience. It’s kind of exciting!

Still trying to figure this out, it's confusing when you don't know quite what you're doing. But it's still fun!
